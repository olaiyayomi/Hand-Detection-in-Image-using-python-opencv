# Hand-Detection-in-Image-using-python-opencv
This Python script uses OpenCV to detect and analyze hands in an image. It reads an image file, isolates red-colored hands, and identifies contours. Information about each detected hand, including number, coordinates, and orientation, is provided. The script distinguishes between left and right hands based on positions.
